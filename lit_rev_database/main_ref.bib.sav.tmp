  abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive overview on the recent advances of         miniature hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). For now, two         conventional types, i.e., fixed-wing UAV and Vertical Takeoff         and Landing (VTOL) UAV, dominate the miniature UAVs. Each type         has its own inherent limitations on flexibility, payload, flight         range, cruising speed, takeoff and landing requirements and         endurance. Enhanced popularity and interest are recently gained         by the newer type, named hybrid UAV, that integrates the         beneficial features of both conventional ones. In this survey         paper, a systematic categorization method for the hybrid UAV's         platform designs is introduced, first presenting the technical         features and representative examples. Next, the hybrid UAV's         flight dynamics model and flight control strategies are         explained addressing several representative modeling and control         work. In addition, key observations, existing challenges and         conclusive remarks based on the conducted review are discussed         accordingly.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we derive a Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) control law for a non-linear system with first order linear actuators, and compare it to Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI), which has gained popularity in recent years. It is shown that for first order actuator dynamics, INDI approximates the corresponding NDI control law arbitrarily well under the condition of sufficiently fast actuators. If the actuator bandwidth is low compared to changes in the states, the derived NDI control law has the following advantages compared to INDI: 1) compensation of state derivative terms 2) well defined error dynamics and 3) exact tracking of a reference model, independent of error controller gains in nominal conditions. The comparison of the INDI control law with the well established control design method NDI adds to the understanding of incremental control. It is additionally shown how to quantify the deficiency of the INDI control law with respect to the exact NDI law for actuators with finite bandwidth. The results are confirmed through simulation results of the rolling motion of a fixed wing aircraft.},
